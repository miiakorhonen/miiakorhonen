ðŸ‘‹ Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @miiakorhonen a.k.a Miia Korhonen, former occupational therapist and now a second-year student of Computer Science and Engineering.
I have started to study CSE at the Unversity of Oulu in September 2024.

At the moment Iâ€™m interested in Biomedical Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and testing.
I have already studied Elementary Programming (Python), Programming 2 (Java), Calculus I and II, Matrix Algebra, Probability and Mathematical Statistics, Electrical Measurement Principles, Human-Computer Interaction, Digital Techniques 1, Principles of Digital Fabrication and Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.
Iâ€™m looking for a summer trainee position for the summer 2026.
You can contact me via email (miia.3.korhonen@student.oulu.fi).

I also have created a mobile application hi-fi prototype related to the course Human-Computer Interaction (5 cr). You can check it out through following link:
