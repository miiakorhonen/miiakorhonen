ðŸ‘‹ Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @miiakorhonen a.k.a Miia Korhonen, former occupational therapist and now a student of Computer Science and Engineering.
I have started to study CSE at the Unversity of Oulu in September 2024.

At the moment Iâ€™m interested in Biomedical Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Applied Computing.
I have already studied Elementary Programming (Python), Calculus I, Matrix Algebra, Electrical Measurement Principles and Human-Computer Interaction. 
Currently I'm learning Calculus II, Probability and Mathematical Statistics Programming 2 (Java) and Digital Techniques 1.
Iâ€™m looking for a summer trainee position for the summer 2025.
You can contact me via email (miia.3.korhonen@student.oulu.fi).

I also have created a mobile application hi-fi prototype related to the course Human-Computer Interaction (5 cr). You can check it out through following link:
